# Icon Assets (Artistry Unity)

This repository contains SVG icon assets for the Artistry Unity application.  
Icons are provided in both "Outline" and "Filled" styles, organized into separate folders for easy access.

## Usage

- All icons are scalable vector graphics (`.svg`) format.
- Use the icons in your app by referencing/embedding the SVG files you need from either the `outline/` or `filled/` folders.

## Organization

- **`outline/`** – Contains outlined style icons.
- **`filled/`** – Contains filled style icons.

Each icon comes in a filled and outlined version:
- Example: `Album_Library_Outline.svg` & `Album_Library_Filled.svg`

## How to Add to Your App

1. Browse to the icon you wish to use—in either folder.
2. Download, copy, or reference the SVG path as required in your app/toolchain.
